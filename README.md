# Graphing

I am planning to create **graphing** software.
This software could take in functions in terms of x 
or theta and this could be graphed in cartesian 
coordinates or polar coordinates. 

This program could be used by math/eng/physics people
who want to graph functions.

This project is interesting to me because I'm looking
into physics and math and how they could be integrated
with computer science. How we can use computer
science as an extremely powerful tool to help
work with abstract things. 






## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to 
- input a function
- change the scope of the displayed graph
- integrate with different accuracies
- change the type of graph (cartesian and polar)
- keep a history of functions (which can be
graphed at the same time)

**Ambitious ideas**

As a user, I want to be able to

- graph with a changing variable
- visualize 3-dimensional graphs + solids
