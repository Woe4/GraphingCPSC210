# Graphing

I am planning to create **graphing** software.
This software could take in functions in terms of x 
or theta and this could be graphed in cartesian 
coordinates or polar coordinates (kind of like desmos).

This program could be used by math/eng/physics people
who want to graph functions and would like some more
visualization of integrals.

This project is interesting to me because I'm looking
into physics and math and how they could be integrated
with computer science. Computer
science is an extremely powerful tool and can
be helpful in working with abstract concepts. 






## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to 
- input a function (and see its graph)
- change the scope of the displayed graph
- integrate with different accuracies
- change the type of graph (cartesian and polar)
- keep a history of functions (which can be
graphed at the same time)
- change the accuracy of the graph

**Ambitious ideas**

As a user, I want to be able to

- graph with a changing variable
- visualize 3-dimensional graphs + solids
