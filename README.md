# Graphing

I am planning to create **graphing** software.
This software could take in functions in terms of x 
or theta and this could be graphed in cartesian 
coordinates or polar coordinates (kind of like desmos).

This program could be used by math/eng/physics people
who want to graph functions and would like some more
visualization of integrals.

This project is interesting to me because I'm looking
into physics and math and how they could be integrated
with computer science. Computer
science is an extremely powerful tool and can
be helpful in working with abstract concepts. 






## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to 
- input a function
- see an arbitrary amount of graphed points 
of the function (adding points to a curve)
- change the scope of the displayed graph
- integrate with different accuracies
- keep a history of functions 
- change the accuracy of the graph
- optionally save my history of functions
- optionally load my history of functions

## Instructions for Grader

- To start inputting, you can input an equation
as a function of x in the middle panel
- Clicking enter will draw the graph on the left panel
- Clicking enter will also add the input in the history
in the middle top panel that is a list of previous inputs
  (add X's)
- The "Clear History" button will clear the history by 
deleting all previous inputs (delete X's)
- Saving can be done with the save button on the right
- Loading can be done with the load button on the right
